        <h2 id="1">Having passion</h2>
        <h6>Posted on 3rd of July 2018 at New Delhi, India</h6>
        
        <p>I had a desrie from childhood that I wanted to be famous through some media, specially youtube, to express myself to thw world through internet and I never thought of expressing and showing what u have indide of u through a web. And now my dream is turning into reality and Im working on it. </p>
        <h2 id="2">Finding a good source</h2>
        <p>I had that dream but never thought of learning and then I was introduced to this good website <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">KHAN ACADEMY</a>and I found where I can learn so easily and free of cost and step by step.</p>
        <h2 id="3">Practicing and motivation</h2>
        <p>I started learning it everyday and now I enjoy using this to express the hidden colors inside of me. And when I do a project, I also can share the work to whoever I wanted and getting their feedback  is a exciting experience. I practice and try not to forget the tags.</p>
